👋 Hi, I’m Sourov Jajodia

I’m a recent Master’s graduate in Information Systems Security with 3+ years of experience building security-focused systems enhanced by AI and LLM-based agentic workflows. My background combines cybersecurity research, applied machine learning, and full-stack software engineering to deliver reliable, production-ready solutions.

My work centers on designing agentic AI systems for security automation and developing scalable software platforms that translate research ideas into practical tools for real-world workflows.
