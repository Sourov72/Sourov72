👋 Hi, I’m Sourov Jajodia

I’m a Machine Learning, Security, and Software Engineer with a Master’s in Information Systems Security.
I have 3+ years of experience across AI research, cybersecurity, and full-stack software development, with a strong focus on building reliable, production-ready systems.

My work sits at the intersection of LLM-based agentic systems, security automation, and scalable software engineering. I enjoy translating research ideas into practical tools used for real-world workflows.
